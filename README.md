authom
=======

authom is an authentication library for node.js. It unifies authentication APIs for multiple services into a single EventEmitter, and works with both the built-in node.js HTTP module and as an Express/Connect app.

authom was designed to solve one problem and solve it well. It has an intuitive node.js-like API, no required dependencies, and doesn't force any particular persistence, session, or middleware approaches on you.

Example
-------

For the built-in node.js HTTP module:

```javascript
// Like socket.io, authom will intercept requests
// for you to help keep your routes clean.

var server = require("http").createServer()
  , authom = require("authom")

server.on("request", function() {
  // your usual server logic
})

// create servers for the services you'll be using
authom.createServer({ /* facebook credentials */ })
authom.createServer({ /* github credentials */ })
authom.createServer({ /* google credentials */ })
authom.createServer({ /* twitter credentials */ })
// ... et cetera

authom.on("auth", function(req, res, data) {
  // called when a user is authenticated on any service
})

authom.on("error", function(req, res, data) {
  // called when an error occurs during authentication
})

authom.listen(server)
server.listen(8000)
```

For Express/Connect:

```javascript
var app = require("express").createServer()
  , authom = require("authom")

// create servers for the services you'll be using
authom.createServer({ /* facebook credentials */ })
authom.createServer({ /* github credentials */ })
authom.createServer({ /* google credentials */ })
authom.createServer({ /* twitter credentials */ })
// ... et cetera

authom.on("auth", function(req, res, data) {
  // called when a user is authenticated on any service
})

authom.on("error", function(req, res, data) {
  // called when an error occurs during authentication
})

app.get("/auth/:service", authom.app)

app.listen(8000)
```

Installation and Setup
----------------------

To install, enter:

    $ npm install authom

To see the demo, enter:

    $ npm start authom

And then head to http://authom.jedschmidt.com (which resolves to your local machine at `127.0.0.1`). `sudo` is needed to bind to port 80, as many providers do not allow callback URLs with a port or `localhost` as the host.

FAQ
---

### How can I add my own service?

See **Extending authom** below.

### Why not just use [everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth)/[passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport)? How is authom different?

authom aims to solve a smaller problem, more agnostically. It trades convenience for simplicity and flexibility. Here are some key differences:

- authom was built for node, and can also work with Express, while everyauth is tied to Express and Connect. everyauth aims for a much more ambitious integration, but at the expense of locking you into a particular stack. authom takes a more UNIX approach; since it doesn't handle logins, persistence, sessions, or anything past authentication, it is more of a tool and less of a framework.

- authom uses native node.js conventions such as EventEmitters and objects, while everyauth uses promises and a chaining config API. This is of course subjective, but the authom API aims to be closer to the APIs of node.js itself.

API
---

### authom.createServer(options, [function(req, res){}])

Creates an EventEmitter for the given authentication service. The service is specified by the `service` key of the `options` object, with all other keys differing based on the service. For example, `github` would be called like this:

```javascript
var github = authom.createServer({
  service: "github",
  id: "7e38d12b740a339b2d31",
  secret: "116e41bd4cd160b7fae2fe8cc79c136a884928c3",
  scope: ["gist"]
})
```

An optional `name` member can also be passed to override that used for authom path matching. So if you had two Github apps, you could set them as `name: github1` and `name: github2`, so that they could be accessed as `/auth/github1` and `/auth/github2`.

You can listen for `auth` and `error` events by:

- listening to a specific service for service-specific events, or
- listening to `authom` for all service events

For example, use this to listen for events from Github, based on the code above:

```javascript
github.on("auth", function(req, res, gitHubSpecificData){})
github.on("error", function(req, res, gitHubSpecificData){})
```

Or, use this to listen to events from all provders, since authom already listens and namespaces them for you:

```javascript
authom.on("auth", function(req, res, data){})
authom.on("error", function(req, res, data){})
```

### authom.on("auth", function(req, res, data){})

Listens for successful authentications across all services. The listener is called with the original request/response objects as well as a service-specific user object, which contains the following keys:

- `token`: the token resulting from authentication
- `refresh_token`: the refresh_token resulting from authentication, if implemented by auth service, otherwise `undefined`
- `id`: the ID of the user on the remote service
- `data`: the original data returned from the service, and
- `service`: the name of the service, given so that you can branch your code:

```javascript
authom.on("auth", function(req, res, data) {
  switch(data.service) {
    case "github": ...
    case "google": ...
    .
    .
    .
  }
})
```

### authom.on("error", function(req, res, data){})

Listens for failed authentications across all services. Like the `auth` event, the listener is called with the original request/response objects as well as an error object, allowing you to provide your own session scheme.

### authom.listen(server)

Listens to an existing HTTP(S) server for `request` events. Like socket.io's `.listen` method, authom will intercept any request whose path starts with `/auth`.

### authom.listener

A standard node.js listener. This can be used for more control over the path at which authom is used. For example, the following two are equivalent:

```javascript
// socket.io-style
var server = require("http").createServer()
  , authom = require("authom")

server.on("request", function() {
  /* your usual server logic */
})

authom.listen(server)
server.listen(8000)
```

```javascript
// route-style
var server = require("http").createServer()
  , authom = require("authom")

server.on("request", function(req, res) {
  if (req.url.slice(5) == "/auth") authom.listener(req, res)

  else {
	/* your usual server logic */
  }
})

server.listen(8000)
```

### authom.registerService(serviceName, Service)

Authom-compliant services can be registered using this method. This is useful for adding custom authentication services not suited to be part of the ```/lib``` core services. (For example a business-specific in-house authentication service.) _Custom services will override existing services of the same name._

```javascript
var authom = require("authom")
  , EventEmitter = require("events").EventEmitter

//Custom authentication service
var IpAuth = function(options) {
  var server = new EventEmitter
  var whiteList = options.whiteList || ["127.0.0.1", "::1"]

  server.on("request", function(req, res) {
    if (~whiteList.indexOf(req.connection.remoteAddress)) {
      server.emit("auth", req, res, {status: "yay"})
    }
    else {
      server.emit("error", req, res, {status: "boo"})
    }
  })

  return server
}

authom.registerService("ip-auth", IpAuth)

auth.createServer({
  service: "ip-auth",
  whiteList : ["127.0.0.1", "::1", "192.168.0.1"]
})
```

### authom.route

A regular expression that is run on the pathname of every request. authom will only run if this expression is matched. By default, it is `/^\/auth\/([^\/]+)\/?$/`.

### authom.app

This is a convenience Express app, which should be mounted at a path containing a `:service` parameter.

Extending authom
-----------------

To add an authentication service provider, add a javascript file for the service at the path `/lib/services/<service-name>.js`. This file should `module.exports` a constructor that returns an EventEmitter that listens for `request` events, and emits `auth` and `error` events to itself.

```javascript
var EventEmitter = require("events").EventEmitter

module.exports = function(options) {
  var server = new EventEmitter

  server.on("request", function(req, res) {
    // respond to the request, redirecting the user as needed

    if (successful) {
      // pass an object containing the service's user data
      server.emit("auth", req, res, obj)
    }

    else {
      // pass an object containing an error message
      server.emit("error", req, res, obj)
    }
  })

  return server
}
```

To make sure that your code can recieve subsequent HTTP(S) calls from the service, use the inbound `req.url` as the callback URL, using the querystring to disambiguate different stages of the authentication process. See `/lib/services/github.js` for an example implementation.

Once you're done, and have written tests, make sure you open a pull request so that the rest of us can benefit!
