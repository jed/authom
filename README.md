Authome
=======

Authome is an authentication library for node.js. It unifies authentication APIs for multiple services into a single EventEmitter.

Authome was designed to solve one problem and solve it well. It has an intuitive node.js-like API, no external dependencies, and doesn't force any particular persistence, session, middleware approaches on you.

Authome is pronounced [ˈôTHəm], like "awesome" while holding your tongue.

Example
-------

```javascript
// Like socket.io, Authome will intercept requests
// for you to help keep your routes clean.

var server = require("http").createServer()
  , authome = require("authome")

server.on("request", function() {
  // your usual server logic
})

authome.createServer({ /* facebook credentials */ })
authome.createServer({ /* github credentials */ })
authome.createServer({ /* google credentials */ })
authome.createServer({ /* foursquare credentials */ })

authome.on("auth", function(req, res, data) {
  // called when a user is authenticated on any service
})

authome.on("error", function(req, res, data) {
  // called when an error occurs during authentication
})

authome.listen(server)
server.listen(8000)
```

Installation and Setup
----------------------

To install, enter:

    $ npm install authome

To see the demo, enter:

    $ sudo npm start authome

And then head to http://authome.jedschmidt.com (which resolves to your local machine at `127.0.0.1`). `sudo` is needed to bind to port 80, as many providers do not allow callback URLs with a port or `localhost` as the host.

Supported services
------------------

- Github
- Google
- Facebook
- Foursquare (thanks to [nodebiscut](https://github.com/nodebiscut))

FAQ

### How can I add my own service?

See **Extending Authome** below.

### Why not just use [everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth)/[passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport)? How is Authome different?

Authome aims to solve a smaller problem, more agnostically. It trades convenience for simplicity and flexibility. Here are some key differences:

- Authome was built for node, while everyauth was built for Express and Connect. everyauth aims for a much more ambitious integration, but at the expense of locking you into a particular stack. Authome takes a more UNIX approach; since it doesn't handle logins, persistence, sessions, or anything past authentication, it is more of a tool and less of a framework.

- Authome uses native node.js conventions such as EventEmitters and objects, while everyauth uses promises and a chaining config API. This is of course subjective, but the Authome API aims to be closer to the APIs of node.js itself.

- Authome works with node.js v0.6. (this was not true of everyauth at the time this library was written)

API
---

### authome.createServer(options, [function(req, res){}])

Creates an EventEmitter for the given authentication service. The service is specified by the `service` key of the `options` object, with all other keys differing based on the service. For example, `github` would be called like this:

```javascript
var github = authome.createServer({
  service: "github",
  id: "7e38d12b740a339b2d31",
  secret: "116e41bd4cd160b7fae2fe8cc79c136a884928c3",
  scope: ["gist"]
})
```

You can listen for `auth` and `error` events by:

- listening to a specific service for service-specific events, or
- listening to `authome` for all service events

For example, use this to listen for events from Github, based on the code above:

```javascript
github.on("auth", function(req, res, gitHubSpecificData){})
github.on("error", function(req, res, gitHubSpecificData){})
```

Or, use this to listen to events from all provders, since authome already listens and namespaces them for you:

```javascript
authome.on("auth", function(req, res, data){})
authome.on("error", function(req, res, data){})
```

### authome.on("auth", function(req, res, data){})

Listens for successful authentications across all services. The listener is called with the original request/response objects as well as a service-specific user object, allowing you to provide your own session scheme. The name of the service is given in the `service` key so that you can branch your own code:

```javascript
authome.on("auth", function(req, res, data) {
  switch(data.service) {
    case "github": ...
    case "google": ...
    .
    .
    .
  }
})
```

### authome.on("error", function(req, res, data){})

Listens for failed authentications across all services. Like the `auth` event, the listener is called with the original request/response objects as well as an error object, allowing you to provide your own session scheme.

### authome.listen(server)

Listens to an existing HTTP(S) server for `request` events. Like socket.io's `.listen` method, Authome will intercept any request whose path starts with `/auth`.

### authome.listener

A standard node.js listener. This can be used for more control over the path at which Authome is used. For example, the following two are equivalent:

```javascript
// socket.io-style
var server = require("http").createServer()
  , authome = require("authome")

server.on("request", function() {
  /* your usual server logic */
})

authome.listen(server)
server.listen(8000)
```

```javascript
// route-style
var server = require("http").createServer()
  , authome = require("authome")

server.on("request", function(req, res) {
  if (req.url.slice(5) == "/auth") authome.listener(req, res)

  else {
	/* your usual server logic */
  }
})

server.listen(8000)
```

Providers
---------

### Github

Start off by [creating an application on Github](https://github.com/account/applications/new). Then, to enable Github OAuth2 authentication on your site, call `authome.createServer` with the Github-specific options:

- `service`: "github"
- `id`: the application's `Client ID`
- `secret`: the application's `Secret`
- `scope` (optional): the scopes requested by your application, as explained [here](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes).

```javascript
var github = authome.createServer({
  service: "github",
  id: "7e38d12b740a339b2d31",
  secret: "116e41bd4cd160b7fae2fe8cc79c136a884928c3",
  scope: ["gist"]
})
```

Make sure that the callback URL used by your application has the same hostname and port as that specified for your application. If they are different, you will get `redirect_uri_mismatch` errors.

### Google

Start off by [creating an application on Google](https://code.google.com/apis/console/). Then, to enable Google OAuth2 authentication on your site, call `authome.createServer` with the Google-specific options:

- `service`: "google"
- `id`: the application's `Client ID`
- `secret`: the application's `Client secret`
- `scope` (optional): the scopes requested by your application

```javascript
var google = authome.createServer({
  service: "google",
  id: "515913292583.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  secret: "UAjUGd_MD9Bkho-kazmJ5Icm",
  scope: ""
})
```

Make sure that the callback URL used by your application is identical to that specified for your application. With the default settings, you'll need a redirect URI of `http://<your-host>/auth?service=google`.

### Facebook

Start off by [creating an application on Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/apps). Then, to enable Facebook OAuth2 authentication on your site, call `authome.createServer` with the Facebook-specific options:

- `service`: "facebook"
- `id`: the application's `App ID`
- `secret`: the application's `App secret`
- `scope` (optional): the scopes requested by your application

```javascript
var facebook = authome.createServer({
  service: "facebook",
  id: "256546891060909",
  secret: "e002572fb07423fa66fc38c25c9f49ad",
  scope: []
})
```

### Foursquare

Start off by [creating an application on Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/oauth/). Then, to enable Foursquare OAuth2 authentication on your site, call `authome.createServer` with the Foursquare-specific options:

- `service`: "facebook"
- `id`: the application's `CLIENT ID`
- `secret`: the application's `CLIENT SECRET`

```javascript
var foursquare = authome.createServer({
  service: "foursquare",
  id: "0DPGLE430Y2LFUCOSFXB0ACG3GGD5DNHH5335FLT4US1QDAZ",
  secret: "WLNCAVFHCMQGVYOZTNOLPXW0XL2KN0DRD1APOA45SRGEZSGK"
})
```

Extending Authome
-----------------

To add an authentication service provider, add a javascript file for the service at the path `/lib/services/<service-name>.js`. This file should `module.export` a single function.

```javascript
module.exports = function(options) {
  var server = this // an event emitter specific to this service

  server.on("request", function(req, res) {
    // respond to the request, redirecting the user as needed

    if (successful) {
      // pass an object containing the service's user data
      server.emit("auth", req, res, obj)
    }

    else {
      // pass an object containing an error message
      server.emit("error", req, res, obj)
    }
  })
}
```

To make sure that your code can recieve subsequent HTTP(S) calls from the service, use the inbound `req.url` as the callback URL, using the querystring to disambiguate different stages of the authentication process. See `/lib/services/github.js` for an example implementation.

Once you're done, and have written tests, make sure you open a pull request so that the rest of us can benefit!
